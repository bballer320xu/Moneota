## Introduction ##
Moneonota is a simple Web Application to help track your giving and recieving.  With Moneonota, you can create Gift List, Christmas Card Lists and Thank You Lists.  It allows you to mark whether you sent or recieved a gift or card from a contact on your list.  For gifts, current prices are automatically looked up for you so you know how much a person spent on you.  

If you ever wonder if you spent enough, too much, or your card list is too long, Moneonota can help.
